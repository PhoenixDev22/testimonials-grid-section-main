## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

- Gap is not supported in some browsers , so I set spacing using margin-top and margin-right which I find is no t convient even using @supports , I think it willl be more styles (Look up for other method)

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.container {
  width: min(95%, 70em)
}
/* Specifying only the width and set aspect ratio  to  1 */
.image{
  width: 32px;
  aspect-ratio: 1;
}
```
